# Problem 6
This problem focuses on __finding max and min values__ from an unsorted array, we are not required to nothing extra 
and here _lies the key_, not being required to sort anything, we can solve the problem with a single transversal and
 two placeholders, as reference for _min_ and _max_ values.

### Time and Space complexity
In this case, we perform a __single transverse__ of the whole input, being the time complexity of __O(n)__. In respect 
to the _space complexity_, we have just a pair of pointers, hence, it is independent from _input size_; __O(1)__.
