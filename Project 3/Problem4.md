# Problem 4
This problem is tackler as the construction of a output list, issue form a single transverse of the elements. By using,
several pointers, it is possible on a __single transverse__ to properly order the provided array.

### Time and Space complexity
In this case the _time complexity_ is precisely, __O(n)__. Analyzing the _space complexity_, due to the non usage of 
__auxiliary tables__ (only a few pointers), it is of order __O(1)__ (excluding the input space).
